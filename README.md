# GraphQL Starter Kit

This starter kit contains a Graphql backend, located in the `server` directory, as well as a React front end, located in the `client` directory.  Each of these has their own readme that contains information about getting set up with local development, as well as other pertinent information about their respective environments.

### Client

The front end directory contains some basic React components, as well as webpack configurations and basic build processes.  There is no central state management, like redux, included in this starter kit.  Testing is done using Jest.  More detailed information about the front end can be found in `client/README.md`.

### Server

The back end directory contains a Apollo Server GraphQL with some basic configurations set up, as well as some example queries/mutations to build from.  Testing is done using Jest.  More detailed information about the front end can be found in `server/README.md`.
